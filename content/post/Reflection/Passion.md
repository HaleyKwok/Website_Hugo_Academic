# The Endless Explorer: Embrace Curiosity, Confront Challenges, and Drive Change.

I believe that the 3Cs - curiosity, challenge, and change - are key factors in my quest to grow and achieve my goals.

Ever since I was introduced to computers in the second grade of elementary school, I have had a keen interest in the machine. However, in secondary school, perhaps due to gender stereotyping in girls' schools, I was advised not to choose subjects that placed too much emphasis on logic and math, and due to the low participation rate of females in science and technology, I passed up the opportunity to study Physics and Information Technology, the two majors that are most relevant to computer technology. After college, I still found myself passionate about science and technology, so I chose to rediscover my love of technology.

My curiosity led me to explore the field of STEM and to participate in the RAIDS human-computer collaborative research program in my constant quest for new knowledge. With the support of the Polytechnic University, I was given the opportunity to participate in the RAIDS Human-Machine Collaborative Research Program. While participating in competitions and winning honors, I cherish the pursuit of new knowledge and technology.

I like to accept challenges and face difficulties. In my research and innovation projects, I look forward to constantly challenging myself and finding innovative solutions to problems. I actively participate in international academic exchange programs and entrepreneurial competitions, and bravely face unknown challenges. This will enable me to break through and realize my potential.

I envision a future filled with the power of change, and I hope to transform my research results into real products and promote the development of the science and technology industry. My love for STEM also makes me interested in influencing more students and expanding the impact of science and technology.

Moving forward, the 3Cs - Curiosity, Challenge, and Change - will guide my direction. I strongly believe that staying curious, embracing challenges, and committing to change will lead to the future I aspire to. I will use the power of the 3Cs to explore, grow, realize my dreams and impact my community.
