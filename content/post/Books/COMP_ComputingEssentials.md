# CHAPTER 1: INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY, THE INTERNEST, AND YOU 

## Information Systems

The way to think about a personal computer is to realize that it is one part of an information system. There are several parts of an information system:
- People are an essential part of the system. The purpose of information systems is to make people, or end users like you, more productive.
- Procedures are rules or guidelines to follow when using software, hardware, and data. They are typically documented in manuals written by computer professionals. 
- Software (programs) provides step-by-step instructions to control the computer to convert data into information.
- Hardware consists of the physical equipment. It is controlled by software and processes data to create information.
- Data consists of unprocessed facts, including text, numbers, images, and sound.
- Information is data that has been processed by the computer.
- The Internet allows computers to connect and share information.

### Software
Software, or programs, consists of system and application software.
1. System software is the set of programs that enables the computer's hardware devices and application software to work together. It includes the operating system and utility programs. 
   - OS: coordinate resources, provide an interface, and run applications. Three types are embedded (real-time, RTOS), stand-alone, and network (NOS).
   - Utilities: perform specific tasks related to managing computer resources. Examples include antivirus, file compression, and backup.
2. Application software
- General-purpose applications: word processing, spreadsheet, database, presentation, and note-taking.
- Specialized applications: graphics, audio/video editing, web authoring, and personal finance.
- Apps: small programs that run on smartphones and tablets. They are available from app stores.


## Hardware
Hardware is the physical equipment that processes data to create information. It consists of input, output, storage, and communication devices.

### Types of Computers

- Supercomputers: the fastest and most powerful computers. They are used for applications requiring complex mathematical calculations.
- Mainframes: large, expensive, powerful computers that can handle hundreds or thousands of connected users simultaneously.
- Midrange (server): less powerful and smaller than mainframes. They are used in businesses that need to share data and information across departments.
- Personal computers (PCs): desktop, notebook, tablet, and handheld.

### Personal Computer Hardware 
- System Unit: the case that contains the electronic components of the computer that are used to process data. It includes the motherboard, processor, memory, adapter cards, ports, and connectors. Random-access memory (RAM) holds the program and data currently being processed.
- Input/Output devices: input devices are used to enter data and instructions into the computer. Output devices display data and information in a form suitable for the user.
- Secondary storage holds data and programs. It is nonvolatile, meaning it does not lose its contents when the computer is turned off. It includes hard disks, solid-state drives, USB flash drives, memory cards, and optical discs (CD, DVD, and Blu-ray).
- Communication devices allow person computers to communicate with other computer systems. They include modems, network cards, and wireless access points. 

### Data 
Data is unprocessed facts, including text, numbers, images, and sound. It is stored in files. A file is a named collection of data that exists on a storage medium, such as a hard disk, CD, DVD, or flash drive. A folder is a named collection of files.
- Document files: created by word processors
- Worksheet files: created by spreadsheets
- Database files: created by database management systems
- Presnetation files: created by presentation graphics programs

### Connectivity 
Connectivity describes the ability of end users to use resources well beyond their desktops. Central to the concept of connectivity is the network or communication system connecting two or more computers. The Internet is the world's largest computer network. The web provides a multimedia interface to resources available on the Internet. 
- Cloud computing users the Internet and the web to shift many computer activities from a user's computer to computers on the Internet.
- Wireless revolutiuon has changed the way we communicate and use computer technology. Wireless devices include tablets, smartphones, and e-readers.
- The Internet of Things (IoT) is a network of physical objects that contain embedded technology to communicate and sense or interact with their internal states or the external environment.

# CHAPTER 2: THE INTERNET, THE WEB, AND ELECTRONIC COMMERCED 

## Internet and Web

### The Internet
Launched in 1969 with ARPANET, the Internet consists of the actual physical network.

### Web
Introduced in 1991, the web (World Wide Web, WWW) provides a multimedia interface to Internet resources. 
Four generations: 
- Web 1.0 (links existing information, search engines)
- Web 2.0 (creates dynamc content and social interaction, social media sites)
- Web 3.0 (identifies relationships between data)
- Web 4.0 (futureists predict connecting data and devices to physical life)


## Internet Access Technologies

## Providers
Internet service providers connected to the Internet provide a path to access the Internet. Connection technologies include DSL, cable, and wireless modems.

### Browers 
Browers (mobile and desktop) provide access to web resources.
- URLs: locations or addresses to the web resources; two parts are protocol and domain name; top-level (TLD) or web suffix identifies type of organization.
- HTML: commands to display web pages; hyperlinks (links) are connections.

## Web utilities
Web utilities are specialized uility programs that make using the Internet and the web easier and safer.

### Filters
Filters are used by parents and organization to block certain sites and to monitor user of the Internet and the Web.

### File Transfer Utilities
File transfer utilities are used to download and upload files to and from other computers on the Internet.
- File transfer protocol (FTP) and secure file transfer protocol (SFTP) allow you to efficiently copy files across the Internet.
- BitTorrent distributes file transfers across many different computers.
- Web-based file transfer services allow you to upload and download files using a web browser.

### Internet Security Suite
Internet security suites are software packages that protect users from Internet and network threats. They include antivirus, antispyware, antispam, and firewall programs.

### Communication
- Email
- Messaging 

### Electronic Commerce
- Business-to-consumer (B2C)
- Consumer-to-consumer (C2C)
- Business-to-business (B2B)

### Cloud Computing 
Cloud computing is the use of the Internet and the web to shift many computer activities from a user's computer to computers on the Internet.
- Clients: corporations and end users.
- Internet: provides the connection between clietns and providers.
- Service providers: organizations with computers connected to the Internet that are willing to provide access to software, data, and storage.

### Internet of Things (IoT)
The Internet of Things (IoT) is a continuing development of the internet allowing everyday objects embedded with electronic devices to send and receive data over the Internet.

Objects include cell phones, wearable devices, and even coffeemakers. 
- The Fitbit is an IoT device (bracelet) that monitors health data and sends that data to a cell phone or personal web page.
- Apple's Health App is a Web 3.0 application that can access Fitbit data, combine it with other related health data, analyze the data, and report back to you through a cell phone.

The Apple Health App reports provide information about users' health, including heart rate, steps taken each day, and an estimate of daily calories burned.

# CHAPTER 3: APPLICATION SOFTWARE

## Application Software
Application software consists of programs designed to make users more productive and/or assist them with personal tasks. It includes general-purpose, specialized and mobile.

## User Interfaces
User interfaces are the portion of the application that allows users to enter and manipulate data and commands. A graphical user interface (GUI) uses icons selected by a mouse-controlled pointer. A window contains a document, program, or message. Software programs with a traditional GUI have
- Menus: present commands listed on the menu bar.
- Toolbars: contain buttons that provide quick access to commonly used commands.
- Dialog boxes: display additional information and request user input.

Software programs with a Ribbon GUI have:
- Ribbons: replace menus and toolbars.
- Tabs: contain groups of related commands. Some tabs, called contextual tabs, appear only when they are needed and contain commands related to the selected object.
- Galleries: like dialog boxes, display a set of choices.

# CHAPTER 4: SYSTEM SOFTWARE

## System Software
System software consists of programs that control the operations of the computer and its devices. It serves as the interface between the user, the application software, and the computer's hardware. It includes operating systems, utilities, and device drivers.
- Operating systems: coordinate computer resources, provide an interface between users and the computer, and run applications.
- Utilities: perform specific tasks related to managing computer resources.
- Device drivers: allow the operating system to communicate with peripheral devices.
- Language translators: convert the programming instructions written by programmers into a language that computers understand and process.

### Operating Systems
An operating system (OS), software environments, software platforms, handle technical details.


#### Functions of Operating Systems
Functions of operating systems include: managing resources, providing user interface, voice assist tools, running applications, and controlling hardware.
Mulititasking: allows more than one program to run at a time. Current programs run in foreground, while others run in background.

#### Features
Booting starts (cold) or restarts (warm) the computer. The desktop is the main screen area that contains the icons, taskbar, and other features. Data and programs are stored in a system of files and folders.

#### Categories
- Embedded: also known as real-time operating systems (RTOS); used with handheld computers; operating system sotred within the device.
- Stand-alone (desktop): controls a single computer; located on the hard disk
- Network (NOS): controls and coordinates networked computers; located on the network server.

#### Mobile Operating Systems
Mobile operating systems are used with smartphones, tablets, and other mobile devices. They include Apple iOS, Google Android, and Microsoft Windows 10 Mobile.

- Android: developed by Google; open source; used by many manufacturers; available on many devices.
- iOS: developed by Apple; closed source; used only on Apple devices.

#### Desktop Operating Systems

- Windows is the most popular desktop operating system. It is used on more than 90% of all personal computers. Innovations	include	Cortana	(accepts	commands through	 text	 or	 speech);	 support	 for	 Windows	 apps	 on	 desktops	 and	 mobile	 devices; improved	gaming	with	the	Xbox	gaming	environment;	a	new	web	browser;	and	support for	Microsoft	HoloLens,	an	augmented	reality	tool.


- macOS is the desktop operating system for Apple computers. It is a closed source operating system adn runs on Macintosh computers. macOS	 X	 is	 the	 most	 widely	 used	 Mac	 desktop	 operation.	 Its	 two	 recent versions	are	(1)	macOS	Mojave	with	Dark	Mode	(darker	color	palettes)	and	improved consistency	with	iOS	(Apple’s	mobile	OS)	and	(2)	macOS	High	Sierra,	which	provided a	new	file	system,	more	secure	data	storage,	improved	video	compression,	and	virtuality support.

- UNIX nad Linux
**UNIX**	was	originally	designed	to	run	on	minicomputers	in	network	environments.	Now, it	 is	 widely	 used	 by	 servers	 on	 the	 web,	 mainframe	 computers,	 and	 very	 powerful personal	computers.	There	are	many	different	versions	of	UNIX.	One	version,	**Linux**,	a popular	 and	 powerful	 alternative	 to	 the	 Windows	 operating	 system,	 is	 open-source software.	**Google’s	Chrome	OS**	is	based	on	Linux.	It	integrates	with	web	servers	to	run applications	and	to	perform	other	traditional	operating	system	functions.	Chrome	OS	is	a popular	 choice	 for	 inexpensive	 notebook	 computers	 using	 cloud	 computing	 and	 cloud storage.	One	limitation	of	these	computers	is	that	their	efficiency	is	dependent	upon	the speed	of	their	Internet	connection.

- Virtualization
**Virtualization**	allows	a	single	physical	computer	to	support	multiple	operating	systems. Virtualization	software	(Parallels	and	VMware)	allows	the	single	physical	computer	to operate	as	two	or	more	separate	and	independent	computers	known	as	virtual	machines. **Host	operating	systems**	run	on	the	physical	machine.	Guest	operating	systems	operate on	virtual	machines.	Parallels	creates	and	runs	virtual	machines	on	Apple’s	macOS	X.

### Uilities

#### Operating System Utilities
Utilities are specialized programs designed to make connection.

- Search programs: find files that meet criteria specified by the user.
- Storage management programs: optimize the use of storage devices.
- Backup programs: copy files to a storage medium.
- Antivirus programs: protect a computer against viruses.
- Troubleshooting (diagnostic) programs: identify and fix operating system problems.
- Virtual assistants: respond to user questions and commands.

#### Utitlity Suites
Utility suites are collections of individual programs available together as a unit. They include antivirus, security, and maintenance programs.

# CHAPTER 5: THE SYSTEM UNIT

The	system	unit,	also	known	as	the	**system	chassis**,	is	a	container	that	houses	most	of	the electronic	components	that	make	up	a	computer	system.	Some	system	units	are	located	in	a separate	case,	whereas	others	share	a	case	with	other	parts	of	the	computer	system.

A personal	computer	is	the	most	widely	used	type	of computer.	It	is	the	most	affordable	and	is	designed	to	be	operated	directly	by	an	end	user.	The five	most	common	types	are	cell	phones,	tablets,	laptops,	desktops,	and	wearable	computers. Each	has	a	unique	type	of	system	unit.

## Smartphones 
Smartphones	 are	 the	 most	 popular	 type	 of	 personal	 computer.	 They	 are effectively	a	thin	slab	that	is	almost	all	monitor,	with	the	system	unit,	secondary	storage,	and all	electronic	components	located	behind	the	monitor. Designed	to	comfortably	fit	into	the palm	of	one	hand	and	accept	finger	touches	on	the	monitor	as	the	primary	input,	cell	phones have	become	the	indispensable	handheld	computer.	


## Tablets

Mini	 tablets	 are	 a	 type	 of	 tablet	 with	 a	 smaller	 screen.	 Although	 mini	 tablets operate	like	a	traditional	tablet,	they	typically	do	not	have	all	the	functionality	of	the bigger	tablets.	Their	most	significant	advantage	is	that	they	are	easier	to	transport	in	pockets and	purses.	

A tablet	is	not	designed	to	be	used	as	a phone	and,	typically,	cannot	be	connected	to	phone	networks.

## Laptops
Their	 larger monitor	 is	 separate	 from	 the	 rest	 of	 the	 computer	 and	 attached	 to	 the	 system	 unit	 with	 a hinge.	 Unlike	 cell	 phones	 and	 tablets,	 most	 laptops	 do	 not	 accept	 input	 by	 touching	 the screen.	Rather,	laptops	typically	use	an	attached	keyboard	and	a	mouse	as	the	primary	input devices.
There	are	several	specialized	laptops	with	features	that	make	them	unique.	Some	of	them are 

- Two-in-one	 laptops,	 which	 include	 a	 touch	 screen	 and	 the	 ability	 to	 fold	 flat	 like	 a tablet	computer.	These	laptops	offer	the	advantages	of	a	laptop	with	the	convenience	of a	tablet.
- Gaming	laptops,	which	include	high-end	graphics	hardware	and	very	fast	processors.
As	 laptops	 have	 become	 more	 powerful,	 gaming	 laptops	 have	 become	 a	 favorite, primarily	due	to	their	portability.	
- Ultrabooks,	also	known	as	ultraportables	or	mini	notebooks,	are	lighter	and	thinner with	 longer	 battery	 life	 than	 most	 laptops.	 They	 accomplish	 these	 advantages	 by leaving	 out	 components	 such	 as	 optical	 drives	 and	 using	 energy-efficient microprocessors.	

## Desktops 
Desktops	 are	 the	 most	 powerful	 type	 of	 personal	 computer.	 Like	 cell	 phones	 and	 tablets, some	 desktop	 computers,	 like	 Apple’s	 iMac,	 have	 their	 monitor	 and	 system	 unit	 housed together	in	the	same	case.	These	computers	are	known	as	all-in-one	desktops.

However,	most	desktops	have	their	system	unit	in	a	separate	case.	This	case	contains	the system’s	 electronic	 components	 and	 selected	 secondary	 storage	 devices.	 Input	 and	 output devices,	such	as	a	mouse,	keyboard,	and	monitor,	are	located	outside	the	system	unit.	This type	of	system	unit	is	designed	to	be	placed	either	horizontally	or	vertically.	Desktop	system units	that	are	placed	vertically	are	sometimes	referred	to	as	a	tower	unit	or	tower	computer. 

### Gaming
1. Mobile	 Gaming:	Mobile	devices,	like	cell	phones	and	tablets,	offer	exciting	game-play	experiences on	the	go.
2. Console	 Gaming:	 The	 most	 popular	 video	 game	 hardware	 isn’t	 a	 desktop	 or	 laptop computer.	It	is	a	specialized	computer	called	a	gaming	console.	Consoles	have	specialized hardware	that	produce	high-quality	graphics	and	sound	and	are	designed	to	take	advantage of	TVs	and	home	theaters.	They	provide	wireless	controllers	for	playing	from	the	living room	couch	and	HDMI	ports	to	support	standard	TV	resolutions	and	sound	configurations. Also,	 because	 consoles	 are	 standardized	 and	 popular,	 they	 often	 have	 large	 libraries	 of games	to	choose	from. 
3. PC	Gaming:	While	mobile	devices	and	console	systems	are	the	most	common	and	popular gaming	devices,	gaming	desktops	and	laptops	offer	unparalleled	experiences	that	attract video	games’	biggest	fans.	Gaming	PCs	offer	the	highest	degree	of	customizability,	with specialized	graphics	cards	and	input	devices.	Although	an	entry-level	gaming	desktop	isn’t much	 more	 expensive	 than	 a	 typical	 desktop,	 the	 price	 can	 quickly	 escalate	 as	 you approach	 the	 cutting	 edge	 of	 graphics	 and	 sound	 ​ technology.	 

> Beyond	offering	the	highest-quality	video	game	experience,	gaming PCs	 also	 have	 access	 to	 niche	 and	 independent	 (indy)	 video	 game	 ​who	cannot	easily	release	games	on	consoles	or	mobile	devices.

## Wearable Computers
Wearable	 computers,	 also	 known	 as	 wearable	 devices,	 are	 one	 of	 the	 first	 evolutionary steps	to	the	Internet	of	Things	(IOT).	These	devices	contain	an embedded	computer	on	a	chip	that	is	typically	much	smaller	and	less	powerful	than	a	cell phone’s.	The	most	common	wearable	computers	are	smartwatches	and	activity	trackers.


## Components 
Personal	computers	come	in	a	variety	of	different	sizes,	shapes,	and	capabilities.	Although they	 look	 different	 and	 each	 has	 its	 own	 unique	 features,	 they	 share	 surprisingly	 similar components,	including	system	boards,	microprocessors,	and	memory
