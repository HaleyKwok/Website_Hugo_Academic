title: University Academic Management System (UAMS)
summary: This is a project (IEOR215) at UC Berkeley, made by Hin Chi Kwok, Gilberto Yarritu, Zixuan Huangfu, Yi Fang and Yu-Heng Ch. The university currently utilizes several disjointed systems for its academic management needs. This fragmentation leads to inefficiencies in academic record maintenance, scheduling, and resource management, making the processes cumbersome and error-prone. The proposed University Academic Management System (UAMS) aims to centralize and streamline the management of academic records, course scheduling, faculty assignments, and classroom allocations. By doing so, UAMS will ensure higher data integrity, improve accessibility, and enhance the decision-making capabilities of academic administrators.

Analysis and Methodology:
1. Simplified Entity-Relationship Diagram (EER) Overview + Expanded EER Diagram (Textual Representation) via MySQL Workbench
2. Implementatin via MySQL shell
3. Implementatin via Jupiter Notebook for better visualization (Using IPython SQL Magicm extension allows us to write SQL queries in Jupyter Notebook cells)
4. Normalization Analysis
