The project aims to tap into the thriving drinks market, exemplified by the success of HeyTea which regularly sees over 400 customers in line. The mission is to enhance the corporate brand's online presence, offer a variety of drinks to consumers, and gather customer insights. A notable achievement includes the development of a webpage that allows visitors to browse products and a connected ASP.NET webpage for user input that feeds into a database. The tools and languages employed are Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code, HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, ASP.NET, and SQL.

The website boasts features like an 'About Us' section with developer contact information, shared values, and shop details, a product catalogue with photos and prices, and a system to display drink photos based on product numbers, with error handling for invalid inputs. The 'Best Seller' section showcases sales records. Customer engagement is facilitated through a feedback form and a VIP signup page that ensures unique discounts post-verification. VIPs can also sign in using credentials to access their discounts.

Despite its advancements, the project acknowledges limitations such as the absence of a VIP sign-in/out system, a comments section, payment processing, and online delivery options. These are identified as areas for future development.
