Features:

1. A book catalogue with search by name, author and category of the books. Note there may be more than one copy of each book, and a book may even be published by different publishers.
2. The ability to deactivate a patron’s account if he/she does not return books after a specific period of time passes.
3. Records of books checked out as well as placed on hold (i.e. “reserved” by a patron to make sure the book is there when he/she gets to the library to check it out).
4. Notifications when the desired book becomes available and reminders that a book should be returned to the library. Both could be sent by email and/or when patron logs in to the LMS.
5. Provide analysis report to management to review the system.
