A Library Management System (LMS) is designed to manage all the functions of a library. It helps librarians and administrators maintain the database of new books and the books that are borrowed by visitors along with their due dates. Without a computerized system to store the data, it is hard to find books, issue/reissue books, and manage all the data in an orderly and efficient way. Viewing this situation, our LMS can completely automate library activities to better maintain, organize, and handle countless books systematically. For example, it tracks the records of the number of books in the library, how many books are issued, or how many books have been returned or renewed or late fine charges. To improve the user experience, administrators can extract the reporting module of the library management system, including registration lists, book lists, circulation, and return reports, for further analysis and optimization of the system.

Features:
1. A book catalogue with search by name, author and category of the books. Note there may be more than one copy of each book, and a book may even be published by different publishers.
2. The ability to deactivate a patron’s account if he/she does not return books after a specific period of time passes.
3. Records of books checked out as well as placed on hold (i.e. “reserved” by a patron to make sure the book is there when he/she gets to the library to check it out).
4. Notifications when the desired book becomes available and reminders that a book should be returned to the library. Both could be sent by email and/or when patron logs in to the LMS.
5. Provide analysis report to management to review the system.
