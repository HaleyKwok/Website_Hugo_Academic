title: Meta-Reinforcement Learning Based Control Approach for Assisting Human-Robot Collaboration in Personalized Production
summary: A Research Project utilized MAML-based 5-step PPO to improve robot’s productivity in HRC by about 75% on average. It aims to enable collaborative robots (cobots) to acquire basic skills and perform tasks based on personalised production requirements, made by KWOK Hin Chi , LI Chengxi, PANG Yat Ming, ZHENG Pai.
