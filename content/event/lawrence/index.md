<!-- Nowadays, with the advancement of production technologies, the manufacturing paradigm has gradually shifted from mass production to a small-batch and high-variety personalized production manner, urged by high flexible automation capabilities. In this paradigm, the existing inspection and assembly processes after manufacturing still rely to a large extent on either human operators with low efficiency or machines with low flexibility. To solve this issue, human-robot collaboration (HRC) has been a prevailing topic of recent concerns. Current robot control strategies in human-machine collaboration are mainly through pre-defined programming and do not yet meet the need for flexible and adaptable tasks in individualised production. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach based on meta-learning to drive robots in HRC. It enables collaborative robots (cobots) to acquire basic skills and perform tasks based on personalised production requirements, improving learning efficiency and thus quickly adapting to new tasks for human operators. The robot control task was carried out in a simulated environment taken from a real production scenario to assess its efficacy. Experimental results show that our proposed method enables the robot to learn and perform HRC tasks quickly and outperforms the baseline DRL method in terms of success rate. -->

Slides can be added in a few ways:

- **Create** slides using Wowchemy's [_Slides_](https://wowchemy.com/docs/managing-content/#create-slides) feature and link using `slides` parameter in the front matter of the talk file
- **Upload** an existing slide deck to `static/` and link using `url_slides` parameter in the front matter of the talk file
- **Embed** your slides (e.g. Google Slides) or presentation video on this page using [shortcodes](https://wowchemy.com/docs/writing-markdown-latex/).

Further event details, including [page elements](https://wowchemy.com/docs/writing-markdown-latex/) such as image galleries, can be added to the body of this page. -->

Lawrence Hall of Science is a public science center located in Berkeley, California that offers hands-on science exhibits, designs curriculum, aids professional development, and offers after school science resources to students of all ages. The Hall was established in 1968 in honor of physicist Ernest Orlando Lawrence, the University of California's first Nobel laureate. The Hall is located in the hills above the University of California, Berkeley campus, less than a mile uphill from the University's Botanical Garden. The Hall is an affiliate of the Smithsonian Institution and offers summer camps in collaboration with the University of California, Berkeley's BEAHRS Environmental Leadership Program. The Hall is home to the National Association for Research in Science Teaching (NARST) and the National Science Education Leadership Association (NSELA).
