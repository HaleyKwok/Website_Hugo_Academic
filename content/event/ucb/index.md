<!-- Nowadays, with the advancement of production technologies, the manufacturing paradigm has gradually shifted from mass production to a small-batch and high-variety personalized production manner, urged by high flexible automation capabilities. In this paradigm, the existing inspection and assembly processes after manufacturing still rely to a large extent on either human operators with low efficiency or machines with low flexibility. To solve this issue, human-robot collaboration (HRC) has been a prevailing topic of recent concerns. Current robot control strategies in human-machine collaboration are mainly through pre-defined programming and do not yet meet the need for flexible and adaptable tasks in individualised production. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach based on meta-learning to drive robots in HRC. It enables collaborative robots (cobots) to acquire basic skills and perform tasks based on personalised production requirements, improving learning efficiency and thus quickly adapting to new tasks for human operators. The robot control task was carried out in a simulated environment taken from a real production scenario to assess its efficacy. Experimental results show that our proposed method enables the robot to learn and perform HRC tasks quickly and outperforms the baseline DRL method in terms of success rate. -->

During my academic exchange at the University of California, Berkeley, I had the opportunity to engage in the esteemed Data Science Discovery Program, which perfectly aligned with my keen interest in software development. This initiative allowed me to work on real-world data science projects, providing a hands-on approach to learning that complemented UC Berkeley's rigorous theoretical coursework. The collaborative environment at Berkeley encouraged me to apply my software development skills in a multidisciplinary context, working alongside experts and peers who shared my passion for innovation. With access to state-of-the-art technology and resources, my experience in the Data Science Discovery Program not only deepened my understanding of data analysis and its applications but also enhanced my proficiency in software engineering.

The campus's world-class resources, including cutting-edge research libraries and specialized laboratories, were instrumental in elevating my learning journey. Participating in diverse campus workshops and seminars, I connected with a community of scholars from all corners of the globe, fostering a vibrant exchange of ideas and cultures. This transformative experience at UC Berkeley not only honed my academic acumen but also prepared me for a future of global engagement and intellectual pursuit.
