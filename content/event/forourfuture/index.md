I believe in the power of the 3Cs, Curiosity, Challenges, and Changes. These are the key elements that drive my pursuit of growth and achieving my goals. Ever since the second grade of elementary school, I have been exposed to computers, and my interest in this machine grew rapidly. During my high school years, due to gender stereotyping and attending a traditional all-girls school with a low participation rate of girls in science and technology, I was discouraged from choosing logic and math-based subjects, causing me to pass up the opportunity to study Physics and Information Technology, which are closely related to Computer Science. While I entered university, I rediscovered my passion for STEM and decided to embrace my love for technology. Because of my background, I was at a disadvantage when it came to choosing engineering subjects such as computer science and electronic engineering in university admission. Fortunately, with the support of my professors, I received the chance to participate in a computer science related projects and took several computer science courses, which really helped me to strengthen my computer science background for my application to the Master of Science in Computer Science.

- **Curiosity** motivated me to explore the STEM field and participate in the RAIDS human-machine collaboration research project, always seeking new knowledge. This curiosity led me into the world of research, and I am grateful to my university for providing me the opportunity to be part of the RAIDS project. While winning awards and honors is gratifying, the pursuit of new knowledge and technologies is what I cherish the most.

- I thrive on **Challenges** and fearlessly confront difficulties. In research and innovation projects, I constantly challenge myself and seek innovative approaches to problem-solving. I actively participate in international academic exchange programs and entrepreneurial competitions, fearlessly facing the unknown. This helps me constantly push my boundaries and discover my potential.

- I am filled with the power of **Change** for the future, hoping to translate research outcomes into practical products and drive the development of the technology industry. My passion for STEM also motivates me to influence more students, expanding the impact of technology.

Although my path to studying computer science sounds rocky, I made no regret on the decision I made earlier because I believe every journey has its value in life. As Steve Jobs said, “You can't connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backwards. So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future.” In the journey of my future development, the 3Cs - Curiosity, Challenges, and Changes - will guide my path. I firmly believe and being sanguine that by maintaining curiosity, embracing challenges, and dedicating myself to change, I will achieve the future I aspire to. With the power of the 3Cs, I will explore, grow, realize my dreams, and make an impact on society. We're here to put a dent in the universe. Otherwise, why else even be here?
