abstract: InnoEx is Asia's most anticipated Information and Technology (I&T) event and the premier business platform for next-gen smart solutions, cutting-edge technologies, and disruptive innovations. The event serves as a vital hub for regional and cross-sector collaborations, with a special focus on the Asian market. Industry 5.0 has attracted worldwide attention with its reference to the human-machine collaborative work model, which allows human operators and collaborative robots to perform a variety of manufacturing and assembly tasks in a shared workspace, and is widely used in the smart factory. However, the control methods and application areas of collaborative robots are still immature, and the robots lack the ability to adapt to new tasks in response to personalized tasks. In order to solve the difficulties of customized production and the lack of robot flexibility, a team of students from Hong Kong Polytechnic University proposes a human-machine cognitive robotic collaborative manufacturing system to improve the efficiency of the collaboration between the two parties. The system combines artificial intelligence with augmented reality and digital augmentation technologies to achieve highly detailed and flexible intelligent operations. The system enables robots to significantly improve their perception, reasoning, and cognitive abilities, so that they can better interact with industrial personnel and accelerate the progress of personalized production.
