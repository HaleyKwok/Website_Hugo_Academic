summary: Supported by Office of the Government Chief Information Officer, The Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, the Hong Kong ICT Awards (HKICTA) is a yearly flagship event in the local information and communications technology (ICT) industry. The Awards aims at recognising and promoting outstanding ICT inventions and applications, thereby encouraging innovation and excellence among Hong Kongâ€™s ICT talents and enterprises in their constant pursuit of creative and better solutions to meet business and social needs.
abstract: Industry 5.0 has attracted worldwide attention with its reference to the human-machine collaborative work model, which allows human operators and collaborative robots to perform a variety of manufacturing and assembly tasks in a shared workspace, and is widely used in the smart factory. However, the control methods and application areas of collaborative robots are still immature, and the robots lack the ability to adapt to new tasks in response to personalized tasks. In order to solve the difficulties of customized production and the lack of robot flexibility, a team of students from Hong Kong Polytechnic University proposes a human-machine cognitive robotic collaborative manufacturing system to improve the efficiency of the collaboration between the two parties. The system combines artificial intelligence with augmented reality and digital augmentation technologies to achieve highly detailed and flexible intelligent operations. The system enables robots to significantly improve their perception, reasoning, and cognitive abilities, so that they can better interact with industrial personnel and accelerate the progress of personalized production.
