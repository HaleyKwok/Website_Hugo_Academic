summary: In this workshop, the speakers, a group of graduate students from Hong Kong Polytechnic University, presented their innovative research on a Mutual Cognitive Human-Robot Collaborative Manufacturing System. This system explores the concept of Industrial 5.0, focusing on human-robot collaborative work environments to improve manufacturing and assembly tasks in smart factories.
abstract: Industry 5.0 has attracted worldwide attention with its reference to the human-machine collaborative work model, which allows human operators and collaborative robots to perform a variety of manufacturing and assembly tasks in a shared workspace, and is widely used in the smart factory. However, the control methods and application areas of collaborative robots are still immature, and the robots lack the ability to adapt to new tasks in response to personalized tasks. In order to solve the difficulties of customized production and the lack of robot flexibility, a team of students from Polytechnic University proposes a human-machine cognitive robotic collaborative manufacturing system to improve the efficiency of the collaboration between the two parties. The system combines artificial intelligence with augmented reality and digital augmentation technologies to achieve highly detailed and flexible intelligent operations. The system enables robots to significantly improve their perception, reasoning, and cognitive abilities, so that they can better interact with industrial personnel and accelerate the progress of personalized production.

The workshop highlighted the growing interest in the field of human-robot collaboration, which allows human operators to work alongside collaborative robots in a shared workspace. However, current control methods and application areas for collaborative robots are not yet fully matured, leading to limitations in handling personalized tasks and adapting to new challenges.

To address the difficulties in custom manufacturing and the lack of flexibility in robots, the team proposed a novel approach using human-machine cognition. Their system combines augmented reality, digital twins, and artificial intelligence to achieve highly precise and flexible intelligent operations. By enhancing the robots' perception, reasoning, and cognitive abilities, the system enables better interaction with industrial personnel, ultimately accelerating the progress of personalized production.

The speakers, Tsang Chin Lok, Li Chengxi, Kwok Hin Chi, each shared their expertise in their respective research areas. Tsang Chin Lok is a master's student in the Department of Aeronautical and Aviation Engineering, specializing in navigation and positioning. Li Chengxi is a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Industrial Systems Engineering and a member of the Research Group on Industrial Digital Service-Artificial Intelligence (RAIDS), with expertise in reinforcement learning, multi-agent manufacturing, and robotics learning. Kwok Hin Chi is an undergraduate student and student research assistant in the Department of Industrial Systems Engineering, focusing on human-machine interaction.

The workshop was well-received, and their efforts were recognized with the 2022 Hong Kong Information and Communications Technology (ICT) Awards: Student Innovation Award. The audience appreciated the potential of their research in transforming manufacturing processes and advancing the field of human-robot collaboration in the industry.
