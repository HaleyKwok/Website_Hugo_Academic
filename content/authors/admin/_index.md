Hi everyone, welcome to my website. I am interested in the areas of Machine Learning, HCI/HRI, and Software Engineering. I strongly believe that the 3Cs - CURIOSITY, CHALLENGE, and CHANGE - will shape my future, help me achieve my goals, and positively impact my community. I am passionate for technology, and I am here to share my journey of rediscovering my passion for STEM. Despite facing gender stereotypes and societal expectations from selecting IT as my career before, I pursue my CURIOSITY and participate in research projects and competitions. I embrace CHALLENGES, seek innovative solutions, and am actively involved in academic exchanges and entrepreneurship. My ultimate ambition is to translate my research into real products, contribute to make CHANGES in the science and technology industry, and inspire others to pursue a career in STEM.

Ever since the second grade of elementary school, I have been exposed to computers, and my interest in this machine grew rapidly. During my high school years, due to gender stereotyping and attending a traditional all-girls school with a low participation rate of girls in science and technology, I was discouraged from choosing logic and math-based subjects, causing me to pass up the opportunity to study Physics and Information Technology, which are closely related to Computer Science. While I entered university, I rediscovered my passion for STEM and decided to embrace my love for technology. Because of my background, I was at a disadvantage when it came to choosing engineering subjects such as computer science and electronic engineering in university admission. Fortunately, with the support of my professors, I received the chances to participate in a computer science related projects and took several computer science courses, which really helped me to strengthen my computer science background.

My curiosity led me to explore the field of STEM and to participate in the RAIDS human-robot collaboration research program in my constant quest for new knowledge. With the support of the Polytechnic University, I was given the opportunity to participate in the RAIDS Human-Machine Collaborative Research Program. While participating in competitions and winning honors, I cherish the pursuit of new knowledge and technology.

I like to accept challenges and face difficulties. In my research and innovation projects, I look forward to constantly challenging myself and finding innovative solutions to problems. I actively participate in international academic exchange programs and entrepreneurial competitions, and bravely face unknown challenges. This will enable me to break through and realize my potential.

I envision a future filled with the power of change, and I hope to transform my research results into real products and promote the development of the science and technology industry. My love for STEM also makes me interested in influencing more students and expanding the impact of science and technology.

Although my path to studying computer science sounds rocky, I made no regret on the decision I made earlier because I believe every journey has its value in life. As Steve Jobs said, “You can't connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backwards. So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future.” In the journey of my future development, the 3Cs - Curiosity, Challenges, and Changes - will guide my path. I firmly believe and being sanguine that by maintaining curiosity, embracing challenges, and dedicating myself to change, I will achieve the future I aspire to. With the power of the 3Cs, I will explore, grow, realize my dreams, and make an impact on society. We're here to put a dent in the universe. Otherwise, why else even be here?
